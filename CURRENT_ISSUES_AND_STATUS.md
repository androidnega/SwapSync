# 🚨 Current Issues & Status

## Status: Backend Server Deployment in Progress

**Last Commit:** `658112f`  
**Deployment Platform:** Railway  
**Expected Time:** 3-5 minutes from last push

---

## 🔴 Active Issues (Will Auto-Resolve After Deployment):

### **1. CORS Errors**
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is not present
net::ERR_FAILED 500/401
```

**Cause:** Backend server is down/restarting  
**Fix:** Wait for Railway deployment to complete  
**Status:** ⏳ Deploying now

### **2. 401 Unauthorized Errors**
```
POST https://api.digitstec.store/api/repairs/ 401
POST https://api.digitstec.store/api/audit/verify-access 401
```

**Cause:** Backend offline or migrations haven't run yet  
**Fix:** Automatic when server restarts with migrations  
**Status:** ⏳ Deploying now

### **3. Audit Code "Invalid" Errors**
```
❌ Invalid audit code or access denied
```

**Cause:** Database columns missing (migrations pending)  
**Fix:** Migrations will add required columns  
**Status:** ⏳ Will run on startup

## ✅ What Happens When Railway Deploys:

```bash
1. Railway pulls latest code (658112f) ✅
2. Installs dependencies ✅
3. Starts backend server...
4. main.py startup_event() runs:
   a. init_db() - Create/update tables
   b. run_migrations() - Add new columns:
      • use_company_sms_branding
      • repair.unique_id  
      • customer.created_by_user_id
   c. create_default_admin() - Works now (columns exist)
   d. SMS service configured
   e. Scheduler started
5. Server online and responding ✅
6. CORS headers working ✅
7. All endpoints functional ✅
```

**Timeline:** 2-5 minutes from last push (658112f was pushed ~2 minutes ago)

---

## 🎯 Expected Resolution:

### When Backend is Online (In ~3 Minutes):

✅ **CORS errors disappear** - Backend serving with proper headers  
✅ **401 errors disappear** - Authentication working  
✅ **Audit codes work** - Database columns exist  
✅ **Repair booking works** - customer_id properly sent  
✅ **Admin profile editable** - Full account management  
✅ **Customer privacy working** - Deletion codes filtered by creator

---

## 📋 Pending Features (Not Critical):

### **A. Audit Code System Simplification**
Current request: Remove permanent audit code, keep only 90-second expiring codes

**Implementation needed:**
- Remove permanent code display from Manager Audit Code page
- Keep only expiring code generation
- Update admin access flow

**Priority:** Medium (current system works, just needs simplification)

### **B. Better Error Messages**
Current: "Not authenticated"  
Desired: More specific error messages

**Implementation needed:**
- Add error boundary components
- Better error formatting
- User-friendly messages

**Priority:** Low (errors will disappear when backend is online)

## 🔍 How to Check Deployment Status:

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Find SwapSync project
3. Check deployment status
4. Look for "Active" status
5. View logs for migration output

### Option 2: Test API Directly
Open browser and visit:
```
https://api.digitstec.store/api/ping
```

If you see: `{"message": "pong"}` → Backend is online ✅  
If you see error → Still deploying ⏳

### Option 3: Check Your Site
1. Go to: https://swapsync.digitstec.store
2. Try to login
3. If login works → Backend is online ✅
4. If CORS errors → Still deploying ⏳

## ⚠️ If Deployment Takes >10 Minutes:

### Manual Fix (SSH into Railway):

```bash
# Connect to Railway
railway shell

# Run migrations manually
cd /app
python migrate_add_sms_branding.py
python migrate_add_repair_unique_id.py
python migrate_add_customer_created_by.py

# Check if columns were added
# Then restart will work
```
