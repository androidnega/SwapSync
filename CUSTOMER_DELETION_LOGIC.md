### 3. Customer Viewing Rules

When clicking the **Eye Icon (👁️)** to view a customer:

#### **Repairer View:**

**Viewing OWN customer:**
```
✓ Your Customer (Full Access)
You created this customer - deletion code visible below

[Customer Details]
Name: John Doe
Phone: 0257940791
Email: john@example.com

🔑 Deletion Code (You Created This)
DEL000123

🔒 Secure Deletion System:
- Only YOU can see this deletion code
- Manager needs this code to delete this customer
- Share it only when deletion is necessary
- Your code cannot delete other users' customers
```

**Viewing ShopKeeper's customer:**
```
🔒 Read-Only View
Created by jane_shopkeeper (shop_keeper)

[Customer Details]
Name: Jane Smith
Phone: 0241234567
Email: jane@example.com

(No deletion code visible)
```

---

#### **ShopKeeper View:**

**Viewing OWN customer:**
```
✓ Your Customer (Full Access)
You created this customer - deletion code visible below

[Customer Details]
Name: Alice Brown
Phone: 0201234567

🔑 Deletion Code (You Created This)
DEL000456

🔒 Secure Deletion System:
- Only YOU can see this deletion code
- Manager needs this code to delete this customer
```

**Viewing Repairer's customer:**
```
🔒 Read-Only View
Created by micky_repairer (repairer)

[Customer Details]
Name: Bob Wilson
Phone: 0241234567

(No deletion code visible)
```

---

#### **Manager View:**

**Viewing ANY customer:**
```
[Customer Details]
Name: Any Customer
Phone: 0257940791
Email: customer@example.com

(No deletion code visible - Manager never sees codes)
```

Managers **NEVER** see deletion codes. They must:
1. Identify customer to delete
2. Find who created it (shown in table)
3. Request deletion code from creator
4. Use code to delete customer

---

### 4. Customer Deletion Rules

❌ **Repairer CANNOT delete any customer**
- No delete button shown in UI
- Backend returns 403 Forbidden

❌ **ShopKeeper CANNOT delete any customer**
- No delete button shown in UI
- Backend returns 403 Forbidden

✅ **Manager CAN delete customers (with CREATOR'S deletion code)**

**Deletion Process:**
1. Manager clicks **Delete** button (🗑️)
2. System shows deletion modal with customer info
3. Shows: "Created by [username] ([role])"
4. Manager must enter **creator's deletion code**
5. Backend validates:
   - Code matches customer's `deletion_code`
   - Code from correct creator
   - Repairer code ONLY works for repairer customers
   - ShopKeeper code ONLY works for shopkeeper customers
6. If valid → Customer deleted ✅
7. If invalid → Error: "Invalid deletion code. You must obtain the correct deletion code from [creator]"

**Security Rules:**
- ✅ Repairer deletion code CANNOT delete ShopKeeper-created customers
- ✅ ShopKeeper deletion code CANNOT delete Repairer-created customers
- ✅ Each code only works for customers created by that specific user
- ✅ Manager must obtain code from the actual creator

✅ **Admin CAN delete without code**
- Bypasses code requirement
- Full system access

## 🔄 Complete Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Repairer Creates & Manager Deletes

```
Day 1:
- Repairer "micky" creates customer "John Doe"
- System generates deletion code: DEL000123
- Only "micky" can see this code

Day 2:
- Manager "dailycoins" wants to delete "John Doe"
- dailycoins clicks Delete → System asks for code
- System shows: "Created by micky (repairer)"
- dailycoins contacts micky

- micky views "John Doe" → Sees deletion code: DEL000123
- micky shares code with dailycoins

- dailycoins enters: DEL000123
- System validates: ✅ Code matches + created by repairer
- Customer deleted successfully!
```

### Example 2: Wrong Code Scenario

```
- ShopKeeper "jane" creates customer "Alice"
- Code: DEL000456

- Manager "dailycoins" wants to delete "Alice"
- dailycoins asks repairer "micky" for code
- micky gives his code: DEL000123 (wrong customer!)

- dailycoins enters: DEL000123
- System validates: ❌ Code doesn't match
- Error: "Invalid deletion code. You must obtain the correct 
  deletion code from jane (shop_keeper)"
```

### Example 3: Cross-Role Code Attempt

```
- Repairer creates customer A (code: DEL000111)
- ShopKeeper creates customer B (code: DEL000222)

- Manager tries to delete customer A (created by repairer)
- Manager enters code: DEL000222 (shopkeeper's code)
- System validates: ❌ Code doesn't match customer A
- Deletion fails - must use correct customer's code
```

## 🎨 UI Visual Indicators

### Customer List Table:

```
Name         Phone       Created By    Actions
-------------------------------------------------
John Doe     0257940791  micky        👁️ ✏️ (editable)
Jane Smith   0241234567  jane_shop    👁️ 🔒 (locked)
Alice Brown  0201234567  micky        👁️ ✏️ (editable)
```

**Legend:**
- 👁️ = View (everyone)
- ✏️ = Edit (only creator)
- 🔒 = Locked (not creator)
- 🗑️ = Delete (managers only)
