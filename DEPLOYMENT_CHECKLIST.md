## üîê Security Setup

### Generate Credentials
```bash
# Generate SECRET_KEY (copy the output)
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"

# Generate secure admin password (copy the output)
python -c "import secrets, string; chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation; print(''.join(secrets.choice(chars) for _ in range(24)))"
```

### Save These Values
- [ ] SECRET_KEY: _______________________________________________
- [ ] Admin Password: ___________________________________________
- [ ] PostgreSQL URL: ___________________________________________

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Render

- [ ] Created new Web Service on Render
- [ ] Connected GitHub repository
- [ ] Set Root Directory: `backend`
- [ ] Set Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] Set Start Command: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- [ ] Set Health Check Path: `/ping`
- [ ] Added all environment variables:
  - [ ] SECRET_KEY
  - [ ] DATABASE_URL
  - [ ] CORS_ORIGINS (with *.vercel.app)
  - [ ] DEBUG=False
  - [ ] ENVIRONMENT=production
  - [ ] ARKASEL_API_KEY (if using SMS)
  - [ ] DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD
- [ ] Deployed successfully
- [ ] Copied backend URL: ________________________________________

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Vercel
- [ ] Logged into Vercel
- [ ] Created new project
- [ ] Imported Git repository
- [ ] Set Framework Preset: `Vite`
- [ ] Set Root Directory: `frontend`
- [ ] Set Build Command: `npm run build`
- [ ] Set Output Directory: `dist`
- [ ] Added environment variable:
  - [ ] VITE_API_URL = https://your-backend.onrender.com/api
- [ ] Deployed successfully
- [ ] Copied Vercel URL: _________________________________________

### Step 3: Update CORS Configuration
- [ ] Went back to Render dashboard
- [ ] Updated CORS_ORIGINS environment variable with Vercel URLs:
  ```
  https://your-app.vercel.app,https://your-app-*.vercel.app
  ```
- [ ] Triggered manual redeploy on Render
- [ ] Waited for deployment to complete

---

## üß™ Testing

### Backend Tests
- [ ] Tested root endpoint: `curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/`
- [ ] Tested health check: `curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/ping`
- [ ] Accessed API docs: `https://your-backend.onrender.com/docs`
- [ ] Verified no errors in Render logs

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Visited Vercel URL
- [ ] Checked for CORS errors in browser console
- [ ] Tested admin login with new credentials
- [ ] Verified API connectivity (data loads)
- [ ] Tested core features:
  - [ ] Customer management
  - [ ] Phone inventory
  - [ ] Swap transactions
  - [ ] Repair tracking
  - [ ] Product sales
  - [ ] Reports generation
  - [ ] Invoice printing

### Database Tests
- [ ] Logged into PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Verified tables were created
- [ ] Confirmed admin user exists
- [ ] Tested data persistence (create & reload)

---

## üìä Post-Deployment Configuration

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up Render health check alerts
- [ ] Configured Vercel analytics
- [ ] Set up error tracking (optional: Sentry)
- [ ] Enabled database backups

### Performance
- [ ] Verified page load times acceptable
- [ ] Checked API response times
- [ ] Monitored database query performance
- [ ] Reviewed Render/Vercel resource usage

### Custom Domains (Optional)
- [ ] Added custom domain to Vercel
- [ ] Updated CORS_ORIGINS with custom domain
- [ ] Configured SSL certificate
- [ ] Updated DNS records

---

## üîí Security Verification

- [ ] Confirmed DEBUG=False in production
- [ ] Verified HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Checked SECRET_KEY is strong and unique
- [ ] Confirmed admin password was changed from default
- [ ] Reviewed CORS is restrictive (no wildcards except subdomains)
- [ ] Ensured .env files not committed to git
- [ ] Verified database credentials are secure
- [ ] Checked API rate limiting (if implemented)

---

## üìù Documentation

- [ ] Updated README.md with deployment info
- [ ] Documented environment variables
- [ ] Noted backend URL for team
- [ ] Noted frontend URL for team
- [ ] Created admin credentials document (secure storage)
- [ ] Documented any custom configurations

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- [ ] Acknowledged: Backups saved to disk won't persist (use database exports)
- [ ] Acknowledged: SMS config from file won't work (using env vars)
- [ ] Acknowledged: Render free tier spins down after inactivity
- [ ] Acknowledged: Database connection limits on free tiers

### Mitigation Strategies
- [ ] Set up external backup solution (if needed)
- [ ] Use environment variables for all config
- [ ] Consider upgrading to paid tiers for production
- [ ] Implement database connection pooling
