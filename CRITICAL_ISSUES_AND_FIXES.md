# üö® Critical Issues & Immediate Fixes Required

## Current Status: SYSTEM DOWN

### **Issue 1: Backend Returning 502 Bad Gateway**
```
GET https://api.digitstec.store/api/swaps/ ‚Üí 502 Bad Gateway
GET https://api.digitstec.store/api/customers/ ‚Üí 502 Bad Gateway  
GET https://api.digitstec.store/api/phones/ ‚Üí 502 Bad Gateway
```

**Cause:** Railway backend is either:
- Crashed after migration
- Out of memory
- Database connection failed

**Solution:** **RESTART BACKEND ON RAILWAY**

### How to Restart Railway Backend:
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click on your backend service
3. Click "‚ãÆ" (three dots) ‚Üí "Restart"
4. Wait 30 seconds for restart
5. Check logs for successful startup

---

### **Issue 2: Frontend Not Deployed**
Console shows `index-DTkWnvcw.js` (old) instead of `index-C5iv5Rxu.js` (new)

**Solution:** Deploy frontend after backend is fixed

---

### **Issue 3: Manager Can Still Create Swaps**
Manager role should be VIEW ONLY for swaps, but can still create them.

**Fix Required:** Update SwapManager.tsx permissions

---

### **Issue 4: Pending Resales Shows 0**  
Backend has the data (Completed Swaps shows "Pending Resale: 1") but Pending Resales page shows 0.

**Cause:** API calls failing due to 502 errors

---

## STEP-BY-STEP FIX PROCESS

### **Step 1: Restart Backend (DO THIS FIRST!)**

1. Open https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find backend project
3. Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Restart" or "Redeploy"
4. Watch deployment logs for:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Migrations completed
   ‚úÖ SMS service configured
   ‚úÖ Background scheduler initialized
   INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080
   ```

### **Step 2: Verify Backend is Running**

Open a new terminal and test:
```bash
curl https://api.digitstec.store/api/ping
```

Should return:
```json
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
```

### **Step 3: Test Swap Endpoint**

After login, test with your token:
```bash
curl https://api.digitstec.store/api/swaps/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

Should return your swap data (not 502)

---

## Fix Manager Swap Permissions

Update SwapManager to block managers from creating swaps:

The form should be completely hidden for managers, with clear messaging that only Shopkeepers and Repairers can create swaps.

---

## Why Pending Resales is Empty

The code is CORRECT. Here's the flow:

1. **Swap Created** ‚Üí Creates `PendingResale` record with:
   ```python
   incoming_phone_status = PhoneSaleStatus.AVAILABLE
   transaction_type = TransactionType.SWAP
   ```

2. **Pending Resales Page** ‚Üí Queries:
   ```python
   GET /api/pending-resales/?status_filter=pending
   ```

3. **Backend Filters**:
   ```python
   query.filter(PendingResale.incoming_phone_status == PhoneSaleStatus.AVAILABLE)
   ```

4. **Should Return:** Your swap's trade-in phone

**But:** 502 errors = API calls failing = No data displayed

---

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### **Pending Resales Page** (after backend restart):
```
Pending Resale: 1

Trade-In Phone:
- Brand: [Customer's phone]
- Model: [Customer's phone model]  
- Condition: Used
- Value: ‚Çµ[trade-in value]
- Status: AVAILABLE

[Mark as Sold Button]
```

### **Completed Swaps Page**:
```
Total Swaps: 1
Completed: 0  ‚Üê Will be 1 after you mark trade-in as sold
Pending Resale: 1 ‚Üê Will be 0 after marking as sold
```

### **Swap Manager** (for Managers):
```
üîí Manager Restriction

Managers cannot record phone swaps. 
Only Repairers and Shopkeepers can create swap transactions.

üí° You can view phone inventory and access other swap hub features, 
but swap recording is restricted to operational staff.

[View Mode Only - No Form Shown]
```

---

## Database Check (Optional)

If backend restart doesn't work, check database directly:

```sql
-- Check if pending_resales table exists and has data
SELECT * FROM pending_resales LIMIT 5;

-- Check your swap
SELECT * FROM swaps WHERE id = 1;

-- Check phones
SELECT * FROM phones WHERE status = 'SWAPPED';
```

---

## Common Railway Issues

### If Backend Won't Start:
1. **Out of Memory:** Upgrade Railway plan or optimize app
2. **Database Connection:** Check DATABASE_URL env variable
3. **Migration Failed:** Check logs for SQL errors
4. **Dependency Issues:** Verify requirements.txt

### If 502 Persists After Restart:
1. Check Railway logs for Python errors
2. Check database connection is active
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Try full redeploy (not just restart)

---

## Quick Test Checklist

After backend restart:

- [ ] Root endpoint works: `GET /`
- [ ] Ping endpoint works: `GET /api/ping`  
- [ ] Auth endpoint works: `GET /api/auth/me`
- [ ] Swaps endpoint works: `GET /api/swaps/`
- [ ] Pending resales endpoint works: `GET /api/pending-resales/`
- [ ] No 502 errors in browser console
- [ ] Pending Resales page shows 1 item
- [ ] Manager cannot access swap form

---

## Frontend Deployment (After Backend is Fixed)

### If using Vercel:
```bash
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

### If using Netlify:
1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Click "Deploy site"

### If using other platform:
- Upload files from `frontend/dist/` folder
- Ensure `index.html` references `index-C5iv5Rxu.js`

---

## Summary

**Current Problem:** Backend is down (502 errors) ‚Üí Everything fails

**Root Cause:** Railway backend crashed/stopped responding  

**Solution Order:**
1. ‚úÖ Restart Railway backend
2. ‚úÖ Verify endpoints respond (no 502)
3. ‚úÖ Check Pending Resales page shows data
4. ‚úÖ Deploy frontend
5. ‚úÖ Block manager from creating swaps

**Expected Result:** 
- Pending Resales shows 1 trade-in phone with "Mark as Sold" button
- Manager sees view-only message, cannot create swaps
- All pages load without 502 errors

---

**Status:** Awaiting Railway backend restart  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - System unusable until backend is restarted  
**ETA:** 1-2 minutes after restart initiated
