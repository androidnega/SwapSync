    🐛 CRITICAL FIX: Sales Revenue Now Correctly Displays Actual Revenue
    
    🎯 BUG FIXED: Sales Revenue was showing ₵0.00 despite actual sales being made
    
    🔴 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
    Backend was querying non-existent database fields:
    - Used Sale.final_price (DOES NOT EXIST) ❌
    - Used Sale.staff_id (DOES NOT EXIST) ❌
    
    ✅ CORRECT FIELDS:
    - Sale.amount_paid (stores final customer payment) ✓
    - Sale.created_by_user_id (stores staff who made sale) ✓
    
    🔧 TECHNICAL FIXES:
    
    File: backend/app/api/routes/staff_routes.py
    - Line 810: Changed Sale.staff_id → Sale.created_by_user_id
    - Line 814: Changed Sale.final_price → Sale.amount_paid
    
    File: backend/app/api/routes/audit_routes.py
    - Line 205: Changed Sale.staff_id → Sale.created_by_user_id
    - Line 209: Changed Sale.final_price → Sale.amount_paid
    
    💰 REVENUE CALCULATION NOW CORRECT:
    Before: db.query(func.sum(Sale.final_price)).filter(Sale.staff_id.in_(staff_ids))
    After:  db.query(func.sum(Sale.amount_paid)).filter(Sale.created_by_user_id.in_(staff_ids))
    
    📊 WHAT NOW WORKS:
    - Sales Revenue displays actual amount paid by customers
    - Counts all sales made by manager and their staff
    - Repair Revenue calculation also verified (was already correct)
    - Total Revenue = Sales Revenue + Repair Revenue
    
    📁 FILES CHANGED:
    - backend/app/api/routes/staff_routes.py (business stats endpoint)
    - backend/app/api/routes/audit_routes.py (audit data endpoint)
    
    ✅ STATUS: Production-ready
    - No linter errors
    - Field names match Sale model schema
    - Revenue now calculates from real sales data
