# Pending Resales System Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Pending Resales tracking system as specified, along with UI improvements and SMS branding fixes.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Pending Resales System Backend

#### New Database Model (`pending_resales` table)
- **Sold Phone Details**: Brand, Model, Value, Status
- **Incoming Phone Details**: Brand, Model, Condition, Value, Current Status
- **Transaction Info**: Type (Swap/Direct Sale), Date, Staff, Profit Status
- **Financial Tracking**: Balance paid, Discount, Final price, Profit/Loss calculations
- **Unique ID**: Format PRSL-0001, PRSL-0002, etc.

**File**: `backend/app/models/pending_resale.py`

#### API Routes
Created comprehensive REST API endpoints:
- `POST /api/pending-resales/` - Create new resale record
- `GET /api/pending-resales/` - List all resales (with filters)
- `GET /api/pending-resales/swaps-only` - Filter swap transactions only
- `GET /api/pending-resales/statistics` - Get statistics
- `GET /api/pending-resales/{id}` - Get specific resale details
- `PUT /api/pending-resales/{id}/mark-sold` - Mark incoming phone as sold
- `PUT /api/pending-resales/{id}` - Update resale record
- `DELETE /api/pending-resales/{id}` - Delete resale record (Admin only)

**File**: `backend/app/api/routes/pending_resale_routes.py`

#### Automatic Integration with Swaps
When a swap is created:
1. **Creates incoming phone record** in inventory with:
   - Status: SWAPPED
   - Marked as available for resale
   - Links to original swap transaction
   - Parses phone description to extract brand/model
   - Includes IMEI if provided

2. **Creates pending resale record** with:
   - Complete transaction details
   - Both sold and incoming phone information
   - Profit tracking ready

**Modified**: `backend/app/api/routes/swap_routes.py`

#### Database Migration
Auto-creates `pending_resales` table on server startup.

**File**: `backend/migrate_add_pending_resales.py`

### 3. Phone Inventory Updates

#### Status Display Enhancement
Updated phone inventory to show accurate status badges:
- üü¢ **Green**: Available
- üü° **Yellow**: Swapped (phones received in trade-ins)
- üî¥ **Red**: Sold
- üîµ **Blue**: Under Repair

Phones received through swaps now appear in inventory with "Swapped" status, making it clear which items came from trade-ins.

**Modified**: `frontend/src/pages/Phones.tsx`

---

### 4. Login Page UI Improvements

#### Removed Elements (as requested)
- ‚ùå SwapSync logo image at top of form
- ‚ùå "‚ÑπÔ∏è About SwapSync" button and modal
- ‚ùå Emoji icons from login method buttons

#### Simplified Design
- Clean "Welcome Back" header
- Simple "Password" and "SMS OTP" toggle buttons (no emojis, no underlines)
- Better positioned and minimal design

**Modified**: `frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx`

---

### 5. SMS Branding Fixes

Fixed all hardcoded "SwapSync" references to use dynamic company names:

#### Updated Files:
1. **`backend/app/core/simple_sms.py`**
   - Welcome SMS now uses company name throughout
   - Changed "Welcome to SwapSync!" ‚Üí "Thank you for choosing {company_name}!"
   - Changed "- SwapSync Team" ‚Üí "- {company_name} Team"
   - Applies to all roles: Manager, Shop Keeper, Repairer, CEO

2. **`backend/app/core/scheduler.py`**
   - Monthly wishes now use company name
   - Holiday wishes now use company name
   - Changed "SwapSync Team" ‚Üí "{company_name} Team"

#### Swap SMS Already Fixed
The swap completion SMS was already using the dynamic `get_sms_sender_name()` function:
```
"Thank you for choosing {company_name}!"
```

This pulls from the manager's company name if branding is enabled, or uses the company name from the database.

## üéØ Business Logic Implemented

### Swap Transaction Flow
1. Customer brings old phone + money
2. Customer receives new phone (marked as SWAPPED status)
3. **Old phone added to inventory** with:
   - Status: SWAPPED
   - Available for resale
   - Linked to original swap
4. **Pending Resale record created** tracking everything
5. When swapped phone is sold:
   - Update status to SOLD
   - Calculate profit: `(Resale Value + Balance Paid) - Original Phone Value`
   - Update profit status

### Inventory Visibility
- Swapped phones show in **Available Phones** list with yellow "Swapped" badge
- Indication shows it came from a swap transaction
- Can be sold directly or through "Pending Resales" interface

---

## üìä Data Tracking

### What's Tracked Per Transaction:
‚úÖ Sold phone (what customer got)
‚úÖ Incoming phone (what shop received)
‚úÖ Transaction type (Swap vs Direct Sale)
‚úÖ Customer information
‚úÖ Attending staff member
‚úÖ Financial details (balance, discount, final price)
‚úÖ Profit/Loss status and amounts
‚úÖ Links to original swap/sale records

### Prevents:
‚ùå Lost phones in inventory
‚ùå Forgotten swap transactions
‚ùå Unclear profit calculations
‚ùå Missing trade-in phone tracking

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### To Use the System:
1. **Backend**: Restart server to run migration
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Frontend**: Access "Pending Resales" from navigation

3. **Testing**:
   - Create a swap transaction
   - Check that incoming phone appears in:
     - Phone inventory (with "Swapped" status)
     - Pending Resales list
   - Sell the swapped phone from Pending Resales
   - Verify profit calculation

### SMS Branding Setup:
Ensure manager has:
1. Company name set in profile
2. "Use Company SMS Branding" enabled in settings

If not set, SMS will use "Your Shop" as fallback instead of "SwapSync"
