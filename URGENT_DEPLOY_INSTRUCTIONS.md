# 🚨 URGENT: Deploy Backend to Fix CORS Errors

## Current Situation
- ✅ Code changes have been pushed to GitHub
- ❌ Backend is NOT deployed yet - still showing CORS errors
- ❌ Your swap data exists but cannot be accessed due to CORS blocking

## Deploy Instructions

### Option 1: Vercel Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
cd backend
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Platform-Specific Deployments

**If using Heroku:**
```bash
cd backend
git subtree push --prefix backend heroku main
```

**If using Railway:**
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Click on your project
- Click "Deploy" button
- Or it may auto-deploy from GitHub

**If using Render:**
- Go to Render dashboard  
- Find your backend service
- Click "Manual Deploy" > "Deploy latest commit"

**If using PythonAnywhere or other cPanel:**
- Upload the changed files via FTP/File Manager:
  - `backend/main.py`
  - `backend/vercel.json`
- Restart the application

### Option 3: Check Current Hosting Platform
1. Open `https://api.digitstec.store` in browser
2. Check what hosting platform is being used
3. Log into that platform's dashboard
4. Trigger a manual deployment

## Verify Deployment Success

After deploying, run this command to test CORS:
```bash
curl -I -X OPTIONS https://api.digitstec.store/api/swaps/ -H "Origin: https://swapsync.digitstec.store"
```

You should see these headers:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS`

## After Deployment

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` and clear cached data
2. **Hard Refresh Frontend**: Press `Ctrl+F5` on `https://swapsync.digitstec.store`
3. **Check Console**: Should see NO CORS errors
4. **Check Pages**:
   - Pending Resales page → Should show your 1 pending swap
   - Swap Manager page → Should show your 1 swap
   - Completed Swaps → Will still be empty until you mark the swap as sold

## Why Your Swap Isn't Visible

Your swap data IS in the database (stats confirm "1 swap, 1 pending"). It's not displaying because:

1. **Pending Resales page** → CORS error blocks loading
2. **Completed Swaps page** → Filters out pending swaps intentionally (only shows completed)
3. **Swap Manager page** → CORS error blocks loading

Once backend is deployed, your swap will appear in:
- ✅ Pending Resales page
- ✅ Swap Manager page (Recent Swaps section)

## Still Having Issues?

If CORS errors persist after deployment:

1. Check deployment logs for errors
2. Verify the new code was actually deployed:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.digitstec.store/
   ```
3. Check if environment variables are set correctly
4. Try restarting the backend service completely

## Need to Check What Hosting You're Using?

```bash
# Check DNS/hosting info
nslookup api.digitstec.store

# Check server headers
curl -I https://api.digitstec.store/
```

The `Server:` header will tell you what platform you're using (e.g., `Server: Vercel`, `Server: cloudflare`, etc.)
