# Multi-Tenant Data Isolation Implementation

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Complete Data Isolation Between Companies**
Every company (CEO/Manager + their staff) now has complete data isolation:
- **Brands** - Each company only sees brands they created
- **Categories** - Each company only sees categories they created  
- **Products** - Each company only sees products they created
- **Phones** - Each company only sees phones they added
- **Customers** - Each company only sees customers they created

### 2. **New User Accounts Start Empty**
When a new CEO/Manager account is created:
- ❌ No pre-filled brands
- ❌ No pre-filled categories
- ❌ No pre-filled products
- ✅ Completely empty workspace
- ✅ Users must create their own categories and brands

### 3. **Super Admin Capabilities**
Super Admins can still:
- ✅ See ALL data across ALL companies
- ✅ Audit any company's data
- ✅ Manage the entire system

### 4. **Data Cascade on User Deletion**
When a user/company is deleted:
- ✅ All their sessions are removed
- ✅ All foreign key references are cleared
- ✅ Activity logs are removed
- ✅ Staff members are also deleted if CEO is deleted

## 📁 Files Changed

### Core Utilities

- **`backend/app/api/routes/category_routes.py`** - Added company filtering
- **`backend/app/api/routes/product_routes.py`** - Added company filtering

### Admin Tools
- **`backend/app/api/routes/maintenance_routes.py`** - Updated reset to include brands/categories
- **`backend/clear_hardcoded_brands_categories.py`** - Cleanup script for existing data

### Migration Scripts
- **`backend/migrate_add_categories_and_phone_fields.py`** - Removed default category pre-fill
- **`backend/migrate_create_products_tables.py`** - Removed default category pre-fill

## 🧹 Clean Up Existing Hardcoded Data

### Option 1: Clean Up Script (Recommended)
Run this script to remove all hardcoded brands/categories:

```bash
cd backend
python clear_hardcoded_brands_categories.py
```

The script will:
1. Find all brands/categories with `NULL created_by_user_id`
2. Show you what will be deleted
3. Ask for confirmation
4. Clear foreign key references
5. Delete the hardcoded data

### Option 2: Admin Panel Reset
1. Login as Super Admin
2. Go to **System Database** page
3. Click **"Clear All Data"**
4. This will delete:
   - All brands
   - All categories  
   - All products
   - All phones
   - All transactions
   - All customers

## 🧪 How to Test Data Isolation

### Test Scenario: Two Companies

1. **Create Company A (CEO1)**
   ```
   Username: ceo1
   Company: Company A
   ```

2. **Create Company B (CEO2)**
   ```
   Username: ceo2
   Company: Company B
   ```

3. **CEO1 Creates Brands**
   - Login as CEO1
   - Create brand: "Samsung"
   - Create brand: "iPhone"

4. **CEO2 Creates Brands**
   - Login as CEO2
   - Create brand: "Tecno"
   - Create brand: "Infinix"

5. **Verify Isolation**
   - CEO1 should ONLY see: Samsung, iPhone
   - CEO2 should ONLY see: Tecno, Infinix
   - Super Admin should see: ALL brands

6. **Test Products/Phones**
   - CEO1 adds phones → Only CEO1 sees them
   - CEO2 adds phones → Only CEO2 sees them
   - No cross-company visibility

## 🔒 Security Features

### Data Access Rules
```
┌─────────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────┐
│ User Role       │ Sees         │ Can Modify  │
├─────────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────┤
│ Super Admin     │ ALL data     │ ALL data    │
│ CEO/Manager     │ Company data │ Company data│
│ Shop Keeper     │ Company data │ Company data│
│ Repairer        │ Company data │ Company data│
└─────────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### Foreign Key Handling
- All `created_by_user_id` fields are used for filtering
- Super Admins bypass filtering (`company_user_ids = None`)
- Staff members see same data as their CEO/Manager

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Deploy to Production
The changes have been pushed to git. Railway will auto-deploy.

### 2. Clean Up Existing Data
After deployment, run the cleanup script:

```bash
# SSH into your production server or use Railway CLI
railway run python backend/clear_hardcoded_brands_categories.py
```

### 3. Notify Users
Inform existing users that:
- They may need to recreate their brands/categories if they were using default ones
- They will no longer see other companies' data
- This is a security enhancement for data privacy

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Database Constraints
- **Products** have `NOT NULL` constraint on `category_id`
  - Products MUST have a category
  - Delete products if their category is deleted

- **Phones** have nullable `category_id` and `brand_id`
  - Can exist without category/brand
  - Foreign keys are just cleared, phones remain

### Migration Behavior
- Old migrations no longer create default data
- Existing installations keep their data until manually cleaned
- New installations start completely empty

## 📝 Summary

✅ **Complete multi-tenant isolation implemented**
✅ **New users start with empty workspace**
✅ **Admin reset includes brands/categories**
✅ **Cleanup script provided for existing data**
✅ **Super Admins retain full access**
✅ **All changes committed and pushed**

Each company now operates in complete isolation with their own:
- Brands
- Categories
- Products
- Phones
- Customers
- Transactions

No company can see or access another company's data! 🔒
