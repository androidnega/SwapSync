# Product Deletion - Complete Cascade Delete Solution

## Problem Statement
When a product is deleted, its historical sales data was still appearing in:
- POS Monitor (https://swapsync.digitstec.store/pos-monitor)
- POS Transactions page
- Top selling products statistics
- Revenue calculations

**User Requirement:** When a product is deleted, **ALL traces** should be removed from the system - no history, no stats, nothing.

## Previous Behavior (WRONG ❌)

When deleting a product, the system would:
1. Delete only the product's items from POS sales
2. Only delete POS sales that became **empty** (no items left)
3. Leave sales that had multiple items

**Example:**
- POS Sale #123 contains:
  - 5x Earpiece (Product A)
  - 2x Charger (Product B)
  
If you delete "Earpiece":
- ❌ OLD: Sale #123 remains, but now only shows "2x Charger"
- ❌ The "Earpiece" still appears in history/stats because the sale record exists

## New Behavior (CORRECT ✅)

When deleting a product, the system now:
1. **Finds ALL POS sales** containing that product
2. **Deletes the ENTIRE sale** (including ALL items in that sale)
3. **Removes ALL traces** from the database

**Example:**
- POS Sale #123 contains:
  - 5x Earpiece (Product A)
  - 2x Charger (Product B)
  
If you delete "Earpiece":
- ✅ NEW: **Entire Sale #123 is deleted** (including the charger items)
- ✅ **Zero traces** of "Earpiece" anywhere in the system
- ✅ Stats, revenue, history - all updated to exclude this sale

## Technical Implementation

### Updated Delete Logic (`product_routes.py`)

```python
# Find ALL POS sales containing this product
pos_sales_with_product = db.query(POSSale).join(
    POSSaleItem, POSSale.id == POSSaleItem.pos_sale_id
).filter(POSSaleItem.product_id == product_id).all()

# Delete ALL items from these sales
if affected_sale_ids:
    db.query(POSSaleItem).filter(
        POSSaleItem.pos_sale_id.in_(affected_sale_ids)
    ).delete(synchronize_session=False)

# Delete ALL POS sales that contained this product
if affected_sale_ids:
    db.query(POSSale).filter(
        POSSale.id.in_(affected_sale_ids)
    ).delete(synchronize_session=False)
```

### Cascade Deletion Order

1. **Find affected sales** - Get all POS sales containing the product
2. **Delete POS sale items** - Delete ALL items from those sales (not just the product's items)
3. **Delete POS sales** - Delete the complete sale records
4. **Delete product sales** - Delete individual product sale records
5. **Delete stock movements** - Delete all stock movement history
6. **Delete product** - Finally delete the product itself

## What Gets Deleted

When you delete a product named "Earpiece":

✅ **POS Sales**
- All complete sales transactions that included the Earpiece
- Example: If Sale #001, #003, #007 contained Earpiece → ALL deleted

✅ **POS Sale Items**
- All items in those sales (even other products)
- Example: If Sale #001 had Earpiece + Charger → BOTH deleted

✅ **Product Sales Records**
- All individual product sale records for Earpiece

✅ **Stock Movements**
- All stock adjustment history for Earpiece

✅ **The Product Itself**
- Earpiece product is removed from inventory

## What Stays (NOT Deleted)

✅ **Other Products** - Products that were never in sales with the deleted product

✅ **Customers** - Customer records remain intact

✅ **Users/Staff** - Staff accounts remain

✅ **Unrelated Sales** - Sales that never contained the deleted product

## User Experience

### Before Deletion
```
POS Monitor:
- Total Revenue: ₵242.00
- 7 transactions
- Top Products: Earpiece (11 units)
```

### Delete Product "Earpiece"
- System finds 7 sales containing Earpiece
- Deletes all 7 complete sales
- Response: "Product 'Earpiece' and all related records have been permanently deleted (7 sales removed)"

### After Deletion
```
POS Monitor:
- Total Revenue: ₵0.00
- 0 transactions
- Top Products: (empty - no sales)
```

## API Response

When deleting a product:
```json
{
  "message": "Product 'Earpiece' and all related records have been permanently deleted",
  "deleted_sales_count": 7
}
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **This is PERMANENT and IRREVERSIBLE**
- Once deleted, data cannot be recovered
- All sales containing that product are gone forever
- Use with extreme caution!

⚠️ **Multi-Item Sales**
- If a sale has Product A + Product B, deleting Product A removes the ENTIRE sale
- Product B's sales data is also lost in that transaction
- This ensures complete data consistency

⚠️ **Revenue Impact**
- Deleting a product reduces historical revenue
- Stats and reports will reflect the deletion immediately
- No trace of the product will remain anywhere

## Testing

1. **Create test sales:**
   - Sell 5x Earpiece → Creates POS-001
   - Sell 2x Earpiece + 1x Charger → Creates POS-002

2. **Check POS Monitor:**
   - Should show 2 transactions
   - Top product: Earpiece

3. **Delete Earpiece product:**
   - Both POS-001 and POS-002 should be deleted
   - Even the Charger sale is removed (because it was in POS-002)

4. **Verify POS Monitor:**
   - Total Revenue: ₵0.00
   - Transactions: 0
   - Top Products: Empty

## Migration Notes

✅ No database migrations required
✅ No breaking changes to API structure
✅ Fully backward compatible
✅ Immediate effect after deployment

## Files Modified

- `backend/app/api/routes/product_routes.py` - Updated delete logic
