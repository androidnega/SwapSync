---

## ðŸ“± Changes Made

### 1. Backend - Product Sale Routes
**File:** `backend/app/api/routes/product_sale_routes.py`

**Changes:**
- Company name now retrieved from **shopkeeper's manager**, not product creator
- If shopkeeper has parent_user_id â†’ get manager's company_name
- If manager recording sale directly â†’ use their own company_name
- Removed broken emoji (ðŸ“±) from SMS
- Changed â‚µ to GHS for better SMS compatibility

**Before:**
```python
# Got company from product creator
manager = db.query(User).filter(User.id == product.created_by_user_id).first()
company_name = manager.company_name if manager else "Your Shop"
```

**After:**
```python
# Gets company from current user's manager
if current_user.parent_user_id:
    manager = db.query(User).filter(User.id == current_user.parent_user_id).first()
    company_name = manager.company_name if manager else "SwapSync"
elif current_user.is_manager:
    company_name = current_user.company_name
```

### 2. Backend - Auth Routes
**File:** `backend/app/api/routes/auth_routes.py`

**Changes:**
- `/auth/me` endpoint now returns manager's company name for shopkeepers
- When shopkeeper fetches their profile, includes parent company name

**Before:**
```python
@router.get("/me")
def get_current_user_info(current_user: User):
    return current_user
```

**After:**
```python
@router.get("/me")
def get_current_user_info(current_user: User, db: Session):
    # Get manager's company name for shopkeepers
    if current_user.parent_user_id and not current_user.company_name:
        parent_user = db.query(User).filter(User.id == current_user.parent_user_id).first()
        if parent_user and parent_user.company_name:
            current_user.company_name = parent_user.company_name
    return current_user
```

### 3. Frontend - Product Sales
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/ProductSales.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Better fallback for company name display

**Before:**
```typescript
setCompanyName(response.data.company_name || 'SwapSync Shop');
```

**After:**
```typescript
setCompanyName(response.data.company_name || response.data.display_name || 'Your Shop');
```

## ðŸ§ª How to Test

### 1. Auto-reload is ON
The backend should auto-reload with changes. Look for:
```
INFO:watchfiles.main:3 changes detected
WARNING:  WatchFiles detected changes...
```

### 2. Test as Shopkeeper
1. Login as shopkeeper (e.g., "emmanuel")
2. Record a product sale
3. **Check SMS** â†’ Should say "DailyCoins" (your manager's company)
4. **Check Receipt** â†’ Should say "DailyCoins"

### 3. Verify Company Name
- Go to your profile
- Should show: `Company: DailyCoins`

## ðŸ“Š Technical Details

### Company Name Resolution Logic:

```
IF user is shopkeeper (has parent_user_id):
    â”œâ”€> Get parent user (manager)
    â””â”€> Use manager's company_name
ELSE IF user is manager (is_manager = true):
    â””â”€> Use their own company_name
ELSE:
    â””â”€> Default to "SwapSync"
```

### Where Company Name is Used:
1. âœ… SMS notifications (product sales, swaps, repairs)
2. âœ… Printed receipts
3. âœ… User profile display
4. âœ… Activity logs
