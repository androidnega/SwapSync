```

**You'll see:**
```
✅ Database initialized successfully!
📊 Tables created: customers, phones, swaps, sales, repairs, users

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Change the default password immediately!
```

   {
     "username": "admin",
     "password": "admin123"

- List of all trade-in phones awaiting resale
- Summary cards (Pending, Completed, Total Value)
- Action button to mark as sold
- Automatic profit/loss calculation

**How to use:**
1. Go to **Pending Resales** page
2. See all swaps with status "Pending"
3. Click "**Mark as Sold**" when you sell a trade-in
4. Enter actual sale price
5. System calculates profit/loss automatically

**Example:**
```
Trade-in: iPhone 8 (valued at ₵3,000)
Cash paid by customer: ₵5,000
Phone given: Samsung S10+ (cost ₵8,000)

Later sold iPhone 8 for: ₵3,200

Profit = (₵3,200 + ₵5,000) - ₵8,000 = ₵200 ✅
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. **Authentication is OPTIONAL**
The system works with or without authentication. You can:
- Use it without login (current behavior)
- Enable login for specific features
- Require login for all operations (future)

### 2. **Default Password**
**Change admin password immediately:**
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Settings or use API
3. POST `/api/auth/change-password`
4. Set new secure password

### 3. **Endpoint Protection**
Currently, most endpoints are **NOT protected** by default. This means:
- ✅ App works immediately without login
- ✅ Can add protection gradually
- ✅ Backwards compatible

To protect an endpoint:
```python
from app.core.auth import get_current_user

@router.post("/")
def create_item(
    data: ItemCreate,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)  # ← ADD THIS
):
    # Now requires authentication
    pass
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option 1: Test Authentication System
1. Restart backend
2. Login as admin
3. Test Pending Resales page
4. Create users with different roles

### Option 2: Enable Full Protection
1. Add auth dependencies to all endpoints
2. Update frontend to always require login
3. Add logout button
4. Add token refresh

### Option 3: Deploy Without Auth
1. Keep auth disabled
2. Use app as is
3. Enable auth in future update
