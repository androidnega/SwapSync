## 💡 Recommendation

Given the extensive scope of remaining features, I recommend we:

**Option 1: Continue Step-by-Step** (Recommended)
- Implement products system first
- Then enhanced sales
- Then profit reports
- Test thoroughly after each feature

**Option 2: MVP Approach**
- Implement core features first
- Add enhancements later
- Get basic version working quickly

**Option 3: Prioritize by Business Need**
- Which feature do you need most urgently?
