## 📁 **Directory Renaming Instructions**

### Current Status:
- ✅ All code changes committed and pushed
- ⚠️ Backend server is running (directory locked)
- ⚠️ Directories still named `swapsync-backend` and `swapsync-frontend`

### To Rename Directories:

**Step 1:** Stop the backend server
- Go to the terminal running the backend
- Press `Ctrl+C`

**Step 2:** Rename using Git
```bash
cd D:\SwapSync
git mv swapsync-backend backend
git mv swapsync-frontend frontend
```

**Step 3:** Commit and push
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: Rename directories to backend and frontend"
git push origin main
```

**Step 4:** Update batch scripts
Update `START_BACKEND.bat` to use `backend` instead of `swapsync-backend`

**Step 5:** Restart servers
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
python main.py

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
