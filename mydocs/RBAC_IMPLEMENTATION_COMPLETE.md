## 🎯 **WHAT'S LEFT TO PROTECT:**

To complete RBAC implementation, these routes still need role protection:

| Route | Required Roles | Status |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| `/api/customers/*` | Shop Keeper, CEO, Admin | ✅ **DONE** |
| `/api/phones/*` | Shop Keeper, CEO, Admin | ⏳ Next |
| `/api/swaps/*` | Shop Keeper, CEO, Admin | ⏳ Next |
| `/api/sales/*` | Shop Keeper, CEO, Admin | ⏳ Next |
| `/api/repairs/*` | Repairer, CEO, Admin | ⏳ Next |
| `/api/analytics/*` | CEO, Admin | ✅ **DONE** |
| `/api/staff/*` | CEO, Admin | ✅ **DONE** |
| `/api/maintenance/*` | Admin only | ✅ **DONE** |

**Note:** Customer routes are now fully protected. The same pattern needs to be applied to phones, swaps, sales, and repairs routes.

## 🚀 **SYSTEM STATUS:**

| Component | Status | URL |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Backend API | ✅ Running | http://127.0.0.1:8000 |
| Frontend | ✅ Running | http://localhost:5173 |
| Electron App | ✅ Running | Desktop |
| Database | ✅ Updated | swapsync.db |
| Users | ✅ All created | 4 roles ready |
| RBAC | ✅ Active | Enforced |

---

## ✅ **NEXT STEPS:**

1. **Test all 4 roles** - Login as each user and verify access
2. **Apply same protection** to phones, swaps, sales, repairs routes
3. **Test unauthorized access** - Try accessing blocked routes
4. **Verify activity logs** - Check that all actions are logged
5. **Review security** - Ensure no bypass methods exist
