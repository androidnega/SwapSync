# SwapSync - Phase 3 Complete ✅

## Database Models and Core Entities

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 3 Complete - Ready for Phase 4

---

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Created 5 Core Database Models**

All models are located in `app/models/` with complete relationships and business logic.

#### **Customer Model** (`customer.py`)
Represents shop clients (buyers, swappers, repair customers)

**Fields:**
- `id` - Primary key
- `full_name` - Customer's full name (required)
- `phone_number` - Unique phone number with index (required)
- `email` - Optional email address

**Relationships:**
- One-to-many with `Swap` (backref: swaps)
- One-to-many with `Sale` (backref: sales)
- One-to-many with `Repair` (backref: repairs)

#### **Phone Model** (`phone.py`)
Represents phones in inventory (new or used)

**Fields:**
- `id` - Primary key
- `brand` - Phone brand (required)
- `model` - Phone model (required)
- `condition` - "New", "Used", "Refurbished" (required)
- `value` - Current market value (required)
- `is_available` - Availability status (default: True)
- `swapped_from_id` - Foreign key to Swap if received through swap

**Relationships:**
- One-to-one with `Swap` (received through swap)
- One-to-many with `Sale` (backref: sales)

**Features:**
- Tracks phone lineage (if came from a swap)
- Availability flag for inventory management

#### **Swap Model** (`swap.py`)
Handles swap transactions between customer and shop

**Fields:**
- `id` - Primary key
- `customer_id` - Foreign key to Customer (required)
- `given_phone_description` - Description of traded-in phone (required)
- `given_phone_value` - Value of traded-in phone (required)
- `new_phone_id` - Foreign key to Phone customer receives (required)
- `balance_paid` - Additional cash paid by customer (default: 0.0)
- `created_at` - Transaction timestamp

**Relationships:**
- Many-to-one with `Customer`
- One-to-one with `Phone` (the phone customer receives)

**Business Logic:**
- `total_transaction_value` property - Calculates total value (given_phone_value + balance_paid)
- Enables profit/loss tracking for swap chains

#### **Sale Model** (`sale.py`)
For direct phone purchases (no swap involved)

**Fields:**
- `id` - Primary key
- `customer_id` - Foreign key to Customer (required)
- `phone_id` - Foreign key to Phone (required)
- `amount_paid` - Total amount customer paid (required)
- `created_at` - Sale timestamp

**Relationships:**
- Many-to-one with `Customer`
- Many-to-one with `Phone`

**Use Case:**
- Direct purchase without trade-in
- Simpler transaction than swap

#### **Repair Model** (`repair.py`)
Tracks phone repairs and their progress

**Fields:**
- `id` - Primary key
- `customer_id` - Foreign key to Customer (required)
- `phone_description` - Description of phone being repaired (required)
- `issue_description` - What needs to be fixed (required)
- `cost` - Repair cost (required)
- `status` - "Pending", "In Progress", "Completed", "Delivered" (default: "Pending")
- `delivery_notified` - SMS notification flag (default: False)
- `created_at` - When repair was registered
- `updated_at` - Last status update (auto-updates)

**Relationships:**
- Many-to-one with `Customer`

**Features:**
- Status tracking through repair workflow
- SMS notification tracking
- Automatic timestamp updates

### 2. **Database Relationships Diagram**

```
Customer (1) ─────> (N) Swap
Customer (1) ─────> (N) Sale
Customer (1) ─────> (N) Repair

Phone (1) ────────> (N) Sale
Phone (1) ────────> (1) Swap (received_phone)

Swap (N) ─────────> (1) Customer
Swap (1) ─────────> (1) Phone (new_phone)
Swap (1) <────────> (1) Phone (swapped_from)
```

**Key Relationships:**
- A **Customer** can have multiple swaps, sales, and repairs
- A **Phone** can be involved in multiple sales
- A **Phone** can come from a swap (enabling chain tracking)
- A **Swap** links customer's old phone description to new phone
- **Repairs** are independent of inventory

---

### 3. **Database Initialization System**

#### **init_db() Function** (`app/core/database.py`)
```python
def init_db():
    """
    Initialize database by creating all tables
    Import all models to ensure they are registered with SQLAlchemy
    """
    from app.models import customer, phone, swap, sale, repair
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
```

#### **Automatic Startup** (`main.py`)
```python
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    """Initialize database tables on application startup"""
    init_db()
```

**Benefits:**
- Tables auto-create on first run
- No manual migration needed for development
- Clear console output showing created tables

---

### 4. **Model Registry** (`app/models/__init__.py`)

All models are properly exported:
```python
from app.models.customer import Customer
from app.models.phone import Phone
from app.models.swap import Swap
from app.models.sale import Sale
from app.models.repair import Repair

__all__ = ["Customer", "Phone", "Swap", "Sale", "Repair"]
```

- Enables profit/loss calculation across swap chains
- Can trace phone history: Customer A → Shop → Customer B

### **Inventory Management**
- `Phone.is_available` flag for availability
- Automatic status updates when sold/swapped

### **Repair Workflow**
- Status progression: Pending → In Progress → Completed → Delivered
- `delivery_notified` flag for SMS automation
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamp

### **Customer Tracking**
- Unique phone numbers with index (fast lookup)
- Relationships to all customer activities
- History of purchases, swaps, and repairs

   - Repair tracking (create, update status, notify)

2. **Business Logic Endpoints:**
   - Profit/loss calculations
   - Swap chain analysis
   - Inventory reports
   - Customer transaction history

3. **Pydantic Schemas:**
