# ⚡ QUICK FIX - Do This NOW!

## The Problem:
❌ You're getting CORS errors and 500 errors because:
- **The backend is running OLD CODE**
- My fixes aren't active yet
- You need to RESTART the backend

## The Solution (30 seconds):

### Option 1: Double-click this file
```
RESTART_BACKEND_NOW.bat
```
It will restart the backend automatically!

### Option 2: Manual restart
1. Find the terminal running the backend
2. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it
3. Run: `python backend/main.py`

### Option 3: Kill all Python and restart
```batch
# In PowerShell:
taskkill /F /IM python.exe
cd backend
python main.py
```

## What You Should See:

✅ SMS service configured from sms_config.json
✅ SMS configured: Arkasel (Primary)
INFO:     Application startup complete.

```

## Then Test:
1. Go to Product Sales page
2. Record a sale
3. Should work instantly! ✅

## Still Not Working?
Check if backend started successfully:

- Should return: `{"status":"ok"}`
