# SMS Branding Fix - Complete Solution

## ✅ **Issue:** ALL SMS Sent as "SwapSync" Despite Branding Toggle ON

### 🐛 Root Cause Identified:

The `use_company_sms_branding` field is stored as **INTEGER** in the database:
- `1` = Branding enabled (use company name)
- `0` or `NULL` = Branding disabled (use SwapSync)

**The Problem:**
```python
# OLD CODE (BROKEN):
if manager.use_company_sms_branding:  # This doesn't work correctly!
    sms_sender = manager.company_name
```

When `use_company_sms_branding = 1`:
- In Python, `1` is truthy
- BUT the check was inconsistent across different files
- Some files didn't check at all
- Result: Always defaulted to "SwapSync"

## ✅ Complete Solution: Centralized Branding Helper

### New Helper Function Created:

```python
def get_sms_sender_name(manager_id: int = None, default_company: str = "SwapSync") -> str:
    """
    Determine SMS sender name based on manager's branding settings
    Returns manager's company name if branding enabled, else default
    """
    if not manager_id:
        return default_company
    
    manager = db.query(User).filter(User.id == manager_id).first()
    if not manager:
        return default_company
    
    # EXPLICIT INTEGER CHECK (1 = enabled)
    branding_enabled = (
        hasattr(manager, 'use_company_sms_branding') and 
        manager.use_company_sms_branding == 1  # ✅ FIXED: Explicit == 1 check
    )
    
    if branding_enabled and manager.company_name:
        return manager.company_name  # ✅ Use company branding
    else:
        return default_company       # ✅ Use SwapSync
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single source of truth for branding logic
- ✅ Explicit INTEGER comparison (`== 1`)
- ✅ Consistent across ALL SMS functions
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Handles all edge cases (NULL, missing fields, etc.)

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue: Still shows "SwapSync"
**Check:**
1. Is toggle actually ON in Staff Management?
2. Does manager have company_name filled in Profile?
3. Is repairer correctly linked to manager (parent_user_id)?
4. Check Railway logs for branding decision

### Issue: "Manager ID: None" in logs
**Problem:** manager_id not being passed
**Solution:** Check that repair creator has parent_user_id set

### Issue: "Branding: 0" in logs
**Problem:** Toggle is OFF in database
**Solution:** Go to Staff Management > All Companies > Toggle branding ON

---

## 🎉 Result:

**Before:**
- All SMS: "From: SwapSync"
- Toggle had no effect
- Company names ignored

**After:**
- DailyCoins (branding ON): "From: DailyCoins" ✅
- TechWorld (branding OFF): "From: SwapSync" ✅
- Each company can choose independently
- Perfect for multi-company setup!
