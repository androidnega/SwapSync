## Fix 1: Phone Product Creation 422 Error

### Problem
When creating a phone product with `is_phone=true`, API returns 422 validation error because:
- Backend requires `phone_condition` (required field)
- Frontend sends `null` when field is empty

### Solution
Update frontend to validate and ensure required phone fields are filled:

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Products.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Add validation before submit for phone products
2. Ensure `phone_condition` is never null for phones
3. Better error messages

## Fix 2: Swapping Flow - Pending Resale

### Problem
Swapped phones need to:
- Be recorded in Swapping Hub
- Marked as Pending Resale
- Track profit when sold

### Current Status
- Swap creation exists in `swap_routes.py`
- Need to ensure pending_resale record is created
- Need to update profit calculation when sold

### Solution
Review and enhance swap creation flow to ensure proper pending_resale creation.

## Fix 3: Repairer Modal - Filter Out Phones

### Problem
Repairers see ALL products including phones in "Add Items Used" section.
Should only see repair-related items:
- Accessories
- Batteries
- Chargers
- Screens
- Repair parts

### Solution
Add filter in repair modal to exclude `is_phone=true` products.

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Repairs.tsx`

**Line 1744-1753:** Add filter:
```typescript
.filter(product => 
  product.quantity > 0 && 
  product.is_active &&
  !product.is_phone &&  // ← ADD THIS LINE
  !selectedItems.find(si => si.item_id === product.id) &&
  ...
)
```

## Fix 4: Manager Dashboard - Phone Stats

### Problem
Dashboard missing phone-specific statistics:
- Total phone count
- Swapped phones count
- Pending resale phones count
- Sold phones count
- Total profit from swapped phones

### Solution
Add new dashboard endpoint or enhance existing ones to include phone stats.

**New Stats to Add:**
```json
{
  "phone_stats": {
    "total_phones": 45,
    "phones_in_stock": 32,
    "phones_swapped": 8,
    "phones_pending_resale": 5,
    "phones_sold": 30,
    "total_swap_profit": 15000.00
  }
}
```

## Fix 5: Performance Optimization

### Current Issues
- Multiple API calls on page load
- No caching for static data
- No pagination on large lists

### Optimizations to Implement

#### A. Reduce API Calls
- Combine related data into single endpoints
- Use query parameters to fetch related data in one call

#### B. Add Caching
- Cache categories (rarely change)
- Cache brands (rarely change)
- Cache product types (static)

#### C. Implement Pagination
- Products list: 20 items per page
- Repairs list: 10 items per page
- Sales list: 20 items per page

#### D. Lazy Loading
- Load repair items only when modal opens
- Load dashboard stats on demand

#### E. Frontend Optimization
- Debounce search inputs (300ms)
- Memoize expensive calculations
- Use React.memo for list items

## Implementation Priority

1. **CRITICAL** - Fix phone creation (users can't add phones)
2. **HIGH** - Filter phones from repair modal (wrong items showing)
3. **HIGH** - Add phone stats to dashboard (data visibility)
4. **MEDIUM** - Ensure swap flow creates pending resale
5. **MEDIUM** - Performance optimizations
